            The very best present we can receive is your presence at our wedding and your love and support as we embark on this adventure together. We recognize that especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding will already entail spending money on travel and hotel accommodations. For those of you who are unable to attend, we send our very best and will save a toast for the next time we see each other!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel inclined to give a gift, we ask that you consider donating to a cause that we are passionate about. We are very fortunate and would like to share our good fortunes amongst the world. We have set up a registry at The Good Beginnings with links to three causes close to our hearts.
