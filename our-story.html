              We met when at an event when we were both in college 9 years ago. Introduced by a mutual friend, we clicked immediately. Before we knew it, we had spent 3 hours in the Fraternity kitchen sharing stories and opinions on current events -- not your typical Frat party conversation! A few days later we met for coffee, fast forward another 4 hours, we knew we had something special!

              Following two years of long distance, we finally made the decision try out a life in Colorado! It's been 6 years, 1 mortgage and many Broncos games and we're still enjoying every minute of this colorful state. We've built our careers and our lives here. We are so excited to share a piece of Colorado that is special to us with our closest friends and family.

              Together we enjoy many adventures in Colorado and abroad. Our passion for trying new things and exploring this beautiful world introduced us to many new hobbies. You may find us snowboarding, camping, scuba diving, traveling our way through life!

              Ireland holds a special place in our hearts. We attempt to journey there annually and enjoy gazing at the coast and soaking in the hospitality. While there are many notable moments, this trip holds an exceptionally special memory. We rented a car and drove up to Northern Ireland to explore the landscape and rich history.

              One morning, although incredibly windy, the sun shone through during our trek at the 16th century castle ruins of Kinbane Head. To say the views were amazing is an understatement. Looking back towards the castle ruins, two waterfalls framed the ruins against the sharp cliff walls with the Scottish coastline off in the distance. Within a moments notice...Eamonn was down on one knee!
